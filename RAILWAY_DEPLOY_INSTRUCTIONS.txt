# Railway Deployment Instructions

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This is a monorepo with TWO separate services (frontend and backend).

## How to Deploy on Railway

### For Backend Service:

1. In Railway dashboard, create a new service
2. Connect your GitHub repository: `shift-handover-intelligence`
3. In the service settings:
   - **Dockerfile**: `Dockerfile.backend`
   - **Build context**: `.` (root directory)
   - **Port**: `8000`

4. Add environment variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./handover.db
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
   DEBUG=false
   ```

### For Frontend Service:

1. Create another service in the same project
2. Connect your GitHub repository: `shift-handover-intelligence`
3. In the service settings:
   - **Dockerfile**: `Dockerfile.frontend`
   - **Build context**: `.` (root directory)
   - **Port**: `80`

4. No additional environment variables needed

### How Railway Will Build Each Service:

- **Backend**: Uses `Dockerfile.backend` which runs from root and copies `backend/` folder
- **Frontend**: Uses `Dockerfile.frontend` which runs from root and copies `frontend/` folder

Both Dockerfiles are configured to work with build context from the root directory.

That's it! Railway will automatically deploy both services.
