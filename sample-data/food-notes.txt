2nd Shift - Pasteurizer Line 2

Near-miss on batch #2401-0107-B at 18:45.

Pasteurization temp dropped to 71.8°C for approximately 45 seconds
(spec minimum is 72.0°C). Flow diverted to rework tank automatically.

Chart recorder confirmed the dip. Looks like steam pressure
fluctuated when boiler #2 was doing its blowdown cycle.

QA manager Sarah notified - she's reviewing if the 45 seconds
below temp is within FDA tolerance for this product type.
We might be able to re-pasteurize instead of dumping.

Batch volume: 5,000 gallons whole milk (Customer: Grocery Chain XYZ)
Value: ~$18,000

Corrective action: Coordinated boiler blowdowns with production
schedule to avoid steam pressure dips during critical phases.

Rest of shift normal - Lines 1, 3, 4 all running on spec.
