Evening Shift Update - Jan 7, 2026

Reactor Train A: Normal operation. All parameters in range.

Reactor Train B: Started trip sequence at 18:20 due to high pressure alarm PIC-405.
Investigation shows pressure transmitter fault (PT-405).
Reactor safely shut down. Estimated restart: 4 hours after transmitter replacement.

Impact: Production reduced by 50%. Customer order #C2401 may be delayed.

Compressor Package: Running at higher load (110%) to compensate for Train B shutdown.
Discharge temperature elevated to 95°C (normal: 85°C). Within acceptable limits but monitor.

Storage: Product tanks adequate for 18 hours at current rate.

Maintenance: PT-405 replacement in progress. ETA 22:00.

Night shift actions:
1. Monitor compressor temperatures closely
2. Restart Train B after PT-405 replacement (follow SOP-405-R)
3. Notify production planning of potential delay
4. Check product tank levels every 2 hours

Open questions:
- Was PT-405 recently calibrated? Check maintenance history.
- Do we have spare transmitters for other critical loops?
