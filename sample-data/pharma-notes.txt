Night Shift - Bioreactor B-201 batch #VAC-2401-07

Batch started at 22:00 yesterday, currently 8.5 hours in.
Temperature holding at 37.2°C ±0.1°C. pH stable at 7.1.
Dissolved oxygen (DO) spiked to 45% at 03:30 when agitator
motor tripped on overcurrent. Reset and restarted - back to
normal at 35% DO.

Concern: Cell viability might be affected by the oxygen spike.
We're past the critical growth phase so might be OK but
QA needs to verify.

Clean-in-place (CIP) system for Tank T-105 completed at 05:00.
Ready for next batch.

Raw material delivery expected at 08:00 - glycerol and peptone.
Make sure receiving team checks COA certificates.
